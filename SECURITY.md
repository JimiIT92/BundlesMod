# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The only supported version will be the latest one, so make sure 
you have it if you want to receive some assistance in case of issues.

You can download the Mod from the [Official CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bundles-mod/files)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The only place to report a bug or an issue is the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/JimiIT92/BundlesMod/issues) of this repository.

**DO NOT SEND EMAILS**. Because they often go into the spam folder, and so they can get lost
or I can read them even months after you send it. So please, if possible, again, use the Issue Tracker (is literally there for this reason)
